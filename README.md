## Introduction
A German keyboard layout for macOS without dead keys.

With passwords, e.g. in Dashlane, etc. with characters that are located on a dead key, it is no longer possible to use them in the hidden input field in macOS. At least, that's what I've found in the past on various Mac platforms.

*Here is the solution!*



## Installation

Just copy the **German NDK.bundle** file to 

    ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/

Alternatively, you can copy the file to 

    /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/

with *sudo*.


The keyboard is set under:

    System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources
